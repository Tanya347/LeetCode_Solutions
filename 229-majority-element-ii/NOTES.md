**Boyre Moore Voting Algorithm for 2 majority elements**
* There's similar intuition behing the working of the algorithm for two elements as it is for one element.
* We keep two majority elements and two count variables.
* Rest all of the working is same, we just have to find the count of the majority elements that we find by using the algorithm and if it is greater then n/3 we push it back to the answer array.
