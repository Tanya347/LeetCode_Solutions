**BIT MANIPULATION**
* we can use & operator with 1 to retrieve the last bit of any integer as the leading zeroes in bits of 1 will nullify everything else and the last bit i.e. 1 will give the desired result.
* we can use left and right shift operators to great use. To remove the last bit use right shift operator and to remove from start left shift operator.
