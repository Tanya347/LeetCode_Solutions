Note down these things :
1. Whenever we have a 2D vector, we can push back arrays like this. {1,2}
2. Always take care of corner and base cases before submitting.
3. To create a vector with predefined size :
  vector<int> pascal (10, vector(5, 1));
  will create a 2d array with size 10 x 5 and insert values 1 at all places for now.
