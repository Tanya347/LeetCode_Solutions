**DIVISON METHOD**
* Counting the number of zeroes, along with finding the product of the whole array.
* If zeroes are greater than 1, then just return a zero array.
* If one zero is there then replace that zero with product of the whole array and the other places with zero.
* If no zeroes are there just replace the element with the quotient that comes by dividing the product with itself.
